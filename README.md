## Why ZotDots Was Created ##
ZotDots, inspired by r/place, was designed to add to the sense of community within UCI. Like every "New Beginning," it starts with a blank canvas and with every Anteater's contribution becomes a beautiful artwork!

## How ZotDots Works ##
ZotDots is a full-stack web application developed using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for frontend and Flask and SQLAlchemy for backend. SQLAlchemy was used to create a database to store and update pixels within our canvas, so existing drawings on the canvas can be seen by every ZotDot user. 


## How To Play ##
One pixel can be placed once per minute.

When the timer is done counting you are able to select a color from the bottom of a screen and then press somewhere in our canvas to place it down.

Compete with other players to be the one to leave your mark!

Band together with your friends to make your Petr dreams come true!
